  <u> To-do list / ideas I have:</u>
  <li> art page, it will have a different repository, with more pages for separate things ! (ex. a series)</li>
  <li> add social links (last.fm, spotify I guess, youtube channels)</li> 
  <li> some b/log sort of thing like in the coding testing</li>
    <li>iframe maybe (iframe of another page on my github so there's no server issues OR HTMLy)<br>
    github page would have to be manual typing posts vs HTMLy is more automated or whatever</li>
  <li> game page of cool stuff I made and maybe more (ones I didn't make)</li>
